# Ollama-RAG-Chat-With-Your-File
This is a chatbot project that answers questions based on the content of a PDF file. Here I used Ollama and Streamlit to build the application.

## Streamlit
This is an interactive webpage builder, which is really fun that it only takes you a couple minutes to build and launch a simple web page!
You can refer to the official documentation: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit
